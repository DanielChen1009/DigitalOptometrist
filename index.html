                &emsp; Hello! Welcome to Digital Optometrist.
                To get started, you will need to press the next button located below this text.
                This program is to help roughly determine your visual acuity or, in other words, how good your eyesight is.
                If you have taken a vision test at a hospital or doctor's office, you might know that
                distance is an important factor in the test. Worry not! You will not have to find a rule to get your
                distance from the camera. We have got that covered for you.
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp; Using this program, you will first measure your distance in the next page and then
                take the test. The test will be conducted using the the letter E oriented in different directions.
                To pass each level of the test, you must read correctly read out the orientation of four out of five
                letters.
                This will decrease the size of the letter after which, you will need to repeat the process until
                you fail a level twice in a row.
